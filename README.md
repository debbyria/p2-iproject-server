# Mogo - Mogo Server Side 
>(assignment for individual project Hacktiv8) by Debby Ria

## What's Mogo-Mogo?
Mogo - Mogo is a web-based application that provides information about a list of restaurants located around the user's desired location. In addition, Mogo - Mogo also offers recipes that users can access by searching for keywords such as chicken. Then, Mogo - Mogo will display a collection of recipes that use the chosen ingredient as a base. Users can also click on a button that directs them to cooking tutorial links on YouTube.
